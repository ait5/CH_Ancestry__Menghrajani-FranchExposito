## Summary
Quantitative inferred ancestry may capture multiple component contributions to phenotypes that extend beyond the effects of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Here, we use self-described ethnicity and quantitative inferred ancestry to characterize the population-based prevalence of clonal hematopoiesis among a cohort of 47,149 solid tumor patients. We find that the odds of CH among those of self-described Hispanic ethnicity are lower than those who do not identify as Hispanic (OR 0.86, 95% CI:0.77-0.96, Q=0.025). Additionally, those of East Asian descent were least likely to have CH. This finding was robust when accounting for age, sex, smoking history, receipt of therapy prior to CH sequencing, and cancer type (OR 0.82, 95% CI:0.73-0.92, Q=0.005). While prior studies of germline predictors of CH have focused on single variants or loci, we present the use of quantitative ancestry inference to capture the complex interactions among multiple genes or haplotypes which may predispose to developing CH.
